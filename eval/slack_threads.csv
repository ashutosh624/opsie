Code not getting detected in the video injection
Please describe the issue (in detail)
Customer is using a video for injection Code for their application. They are using Scandit https://www.scandit.com/ video kernel in their app. The application opens but the code is not scanned, I have added the padding as part of the debugging steps.
Attaching the verbose logs from the session on App Live.
Expected Behaviour
It should scan the first image and then wait for the next image.
Actual Behaviour
It does not scan and just shows 0/2.
Share debugging done (in detail)
App does not crash when video injection is used. Locally works fine on physical device.
No
App is using Scandit video kernel, was able to find MockActivity:captureIntent: called with intent: Intent { cmp=com.xpo.drivermobile.lastmile.RN/net.openid.appauth.AuthorizationManagementActivity (has extras) } requestCode: 52 line in the logs.
Did not try since please enable the Preview Layer Mocking for grp 8582898
Video injection usecase confirmed by the customer.
Added padding and checked still did not work

Context: Had a sync with @harshit.s regarding the modifications that can be done for Pager alerts owned by devicefeatures team -> specifically those which do JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR computations. The intent was to move them to in-memory based processing. As discussed, I have created the PR for the same https://github.com/browserstack/zombies/pull/6706
Pls review and approve

Expected Behaviour
Should see the injected image
Actual Behaviour
Seeing a black screen after capturing and uploading the image
Share debugging done (in detail)
Followed the debugging doc, below are the details:
Step1: Sign the app locally and check if the expected use case is working on local device.
Didnt try this since the app is not crashing
Tried testing the original app on a physical device and it is working as expected.
Step2: Check with customer if app has any anti tampering mechanism
NA: the app isnt crashing
Step3: Check what API’s app is using too see if those APIs are even supported on BrowserStack
As per the customer the app is using CameraX API
However, we are unable to see any supported APIs in the logs
Attaching the device logs of both Group 2 and non-Group 2 sessions
Step4: Check if app is using Preview Layer
Tried enabling 'Camera Preview' on a non-group 2 account, the issue persists
Step5: Check if app has any use of Video Injection
Tried with a sample video as well, didnt work
Step6: Check for Padding
Does not seem to be related to padding as we are getting a black image with any image
Tried using different images of different sizes
Steps to reproduce the issue
Hashed ID: 3ed23efe0f01433bc0a7b076fc6ffaaa06c56809
Company = ReferenceA
Email = pdg.test4@hrsid.com
Password = Browserstack1!
Open the app - you should see the login form.
Enter Company name in the top field - Enter 'Staging1' here
Enter email address & password and tap the 'Sign In' button.
Email Address = pdg.test11@hrsid.com
Password = Browserstack1!
After successfully signing in and you have waited for the app to complete it's sync. You should arrive at the home screen showing our different modules, here tap the 'Briefings' module (you may have to scroll down to see this).
Tap 'Sites/Projects' and select any site from the list on the following page.
Tap 'Course' and select any available course for the site you selected.
Tap 'Module' and select any available module.
Once here, select the 'Attachments' option, and then click the 'Add' button top right.
Now select the 'Photo' option from the popup menu. This should prompt the devices camera to show and this is the point at which we should be able to do media injection.
You can then use the image capture button to take an image.
You can now see the uploaded photo attachment, if you click the bin icon it will show a preview of the image captured.
You will see a black image preview on BS devices

Tried padding, however, still facing the issue.
Tried on a physical device, working fine.
As per the documentation, it is mentioned that:
If you see this log line while checking for Image Injection Intent flow, then raise request on #help-device-features and tag @df-product to enable Chooser Intent support for your app, and then test the app with that feature.
We were able to locate the following while replicating:
MockActivity:captureIntent: Identified this intent as IMAGE_CAPTURE

What is the issue?
Customer's app is detecting the camera view via Hardware and hence while doing the video injection they are getting an error as ""Phone Not Straight""
Please describe the issue (in detail)
Customer is having an application for submitting visa applications. Their camera is detecting liveliness, hence doing a video injection in the app. When we are trying to do the same, on the screen we are seeing ""Phone not straight"" warning coming. Customer confirmed they are detecting it via the hardware to check the device orientation because of which the flow is not moving ahead.
Expected Behaviour
The camera should detect the face and move ahead with the flow of capturing the face of the customer.
Actual Behaviour
While detecting the face with the video injection, we are getting phone not straight warning at the top.
Share debugging done (in detail)
I tried to sign the application locally and then ran it locally, but it was working only when I kept the phone exactly straight, even if i tried to tilt it a little, it was giving me phone not straight warning on the real device as well.
There is no anti tampering mechanism present in the app.
I checked the API which was getting called and we supported those API's as well
I checked with and without preview layer as well. Getting the same warning.
Customer is having some liveliness detection in their app, hence using video to upload.
No padding issues as well.

Customer name: Hinge Health
Customer is getting a black screen with their application, when we tried we were able to replicate the issue
The customer has confirmed that their application does not include the FLAG_SECURE setting.
Supported APIs across Android versions for Camera Injection Documentation:
Android
Android 6 and above	

android.hardware.camera.PreviewCallback API for API level 1-20

android.hardware.camera2.CameraManager, android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice, android.hardware.camera2.CameraCharacteristics, android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession, android.hardware.camera2.CaptureRequest, android.media.ImageReader APIs for API level >=21

Camera Intent API
One possible hypothesis from my side is that the application might not be invoking the necessary camera APIs as outlined in the documentation. Could you confirm if the same set of APIs is required for video injection to work properly as well? This will help me verify with the customer whether these APIs are being called within their app.

certificate pinning issue
Please describe the issue (in detail)
They get a certificate pinning error in AA and AL except for AL when they have network logs enabled.  I do see a message saying that ""SSL checks have been successfully bypassed for the app""
Expected Behaviour
App should work in AL without network logs (mainly because this is default), and in AA with network logs (they use them for debugging)
Actual Behaviour
It only works in AL with debugging enabled
Share debugging done (in detail)
I was able to reproduce this
Steps to reproduce the issue
We have app access permission from the user.  I reproduced it by following the steps in this test: https://app-automate.browserstack.com/dashboard/v2/builds/d26d03cd49dd2973da0a94c7f0f5d7580[…]8f5a65c4453dfae88337a30ff9a64e1080b069b8723517b10ad6be
When it's working, they should see blood pressure displayed like it is in the attached screenshot from AL with the network logs enabled.

The Visa and Mastercard options are most of the time unavailable , Referring to previous thread I informed them that the availability issue is a payment gateway provider issue.
However , When customer is using a Visa card from his website it goes through without any issue. Now customer wants to know if that is a different Testing provider? ( How is visa working through his website but on BrowserStack the card network shows unavailable).
They are planning to purchase BrowserStack licenses , however the problem is with the card network that they want us to address.

Title: Biometric Prompt Not Triggered on App Relaunch in Same Session – App Automate
Details:
The customer has implemented biometric login in their app. Here’s the flow:
User logs in and enables biometrics from app settings.
 2.  User closes (terminates) the app.
 3.  User relaunches the app within the same App Automate session.
Issue:
On relaunch, the biometric prompt does not appear — the app bypasses it and logs the user in directly.
The customer expects the biometric prompt to be shown again, similar to behaviour seen on a real physical device.
Customer Session:
bf5a06b04752b20d1c29bd47cfbf7fadbeb1f38f
Observed Behaviour:
Able to replicate the same behaviour on App Live.
On real devices, the biometric prompt is triggered again on relaunch.
Is this expected behaviour on App Automate? Does biometric state persist in the session even after app termination?",,,

-- BrowserStack devices currently do not support access to a real wallet app, which is essential for simulating tokenized card transactions using CRYPTOGRAM_3DS.

-- Our integration is configured to use only CRYPTOGRAM_3DS, explicitly excluding PAN_ONLY, due to security and compliance requirements.

-- Since PAN_ONLY is generally the only supported method in the BrowserStack environment, this causes an incompatibility for our use case.

Given this, our testing scope using BrowserStack will be limited when it comes to validating Google Pay flows that require CRYPTOGRAM_3DS.

Could you confirm whether there are any upcoming changes or workarounds we should be aware of?
In one of the older threads we found that we do not support CRYPTOGRAM_3DS for Google Pay.. Is it still the case?
Could you please help with

Video injection
For which OS?
iOS
Product?
AppLive
What is the issue?
Injected video is not being selected; instead, the app captures a live recording from the device.
Please describe the issue (in detail)
It appears that the video is being ""injected"", but when attempting to attach a video inside the app, it pulls the video from the device’s camera rather than using the injected source. This issue occurs during a media capture workflow where selecting a video from the device library is not a valid workaround.
Expected Behaviour
Once the video capture workflow is triggered, the injected video should be automatically selected and uploaded to the app.
Actual Behaviour
The app captures a new live recording (with a black screen) and uploads that instead of using the injected video.
Share debugging done (in detail)
Step 1: Signed the app locally and tested on a handheld iPhone device. The workflow worked as expected.
Step 2: Confirmed with the customer that there is no anti-tampering mechanism. The app does not crash during testing.
Step 3: Checked API compatibility:
Tried on multiple iPhone devices.
On iPhone 13: found AVCaptureVideoDataOutput log line.
On iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 Plus: this log line was not observed.
Issue persists across all tested devices.
Step 4: Confirmed that the app has a valid use case for video injection. The scenario involves recording a new video and uploading it through the app. Using a video from the device's existing library does not fulfill the use case.
Step 5: Checked for padding-related issues by uploading a video captured on a physical iPhone device. Issue still persists, so padding is not likely the cause.
Steps to reproduce the issue
Log in to the app using the following details:
Account: origamimobile
Environment: pre-prod
Passcode (shared login): 656565 (select login with passcode)
After logging in, navigate to:
Forms → Audit → New
Select the Media form template titled ""Susannah's Media Form""
Click on the dropdown and proceed with the workflow to record and attach a video within the form.

Video Injection Feature not working on Android
Please describe the issue (in detail)
A customer is unable to complete video recording using the video injection feature on App Live.
App: Uses the CameraX library
Issue: The app detects the injected video (a ""perfect hold still"" notification appears), but the recording process fails to complete. Works fine on IOS devices but not on all android devices.
Expected Behaviour
Record button is pressed, you can see the ""perfect, hold still "" flag is shown, once this is triggered, a blue circle loads indicating that the record phase is successful and the video should be captured  on the app.
Actual Behaviour
""Perfect Hold Still"" flag shows up but the recording phase isn't completed
Share debugging done (in detail)
Have confirmed the feature works perfectly on a signed, local version of the app.
The customer also states there are no anti-tampering measures in place
Have also tried with multiple video uploads so the padding issue can also be ruled out.

Feature: Image Injection
Query:
Hi Team,
We have a customer using the image injection feature on App Live and facing an issue when attempting to scan multiple images sequentially using a scanner within their app.
Use Case:
The app has a scanner interface that expects two images to be scanned sequentially (e.g., 0/2 → 1/2 → 2/2).
The user injects the first image, and the app correctly registers it (counter changes to 1/2).
On injecting the second image, the scanner does not detect it immediately, and the counter stays at 1/2.
If the user closes and reopens the scanner, the second image appears and is detected, but then the first image needs to be scanned first and this cant be done
The use case requires both images to be scanned one after the other within the same scanner session.
Questions:
Is this expected behavior with current image injection implementation?
Are there any workarounds possible that could allow multiple sequential image scans?
I advised the user to try video injection showing both images sequentially, but the user wants to know if there is any way to use Image Injection

We had @Winston Pais from Live Engineering Team with us for this

We had @Mayank Chaurasia from App Live Engineering for this on the call
For Android :
As suggested by @Avideep Gabhawala @Tirth Shah on the thread, First we tried converting the different formats to .cer, but we couldn't convert the .crt one
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -out certificate.cer -outform PEM
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -out certificate.cer -outform DER

openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -out certificate.cer -outform DER
unable to load certificate
140591502489408:error:0909006C:PEM routines:get_name:no start line:crypto/pem/pem_lib.c:745:Expecting: TRUSTED CERTIFICATE
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout
then we were able to upload that .crt file via file injection and customer verified the installation with the help of @Mayank Chaurasia [ Certificate management app -> Trusted credentials -> User tab ]
then they mentioned they need their certificates in certain order, which they will sync with their cert expert sushil internally and get back to us, to answer if the uploaded certs worked perfectly or not
For IOS :
There is workaround like android to upload the .crt format ( so the customer will check internally to see if its possible from their end to convert the .crt to .cer format )
also we @Mayank Chaurasia had enabled access to settings for one of their session, to verify if the certs ( in .cer ) format were getting uploaded, which we could see in the attached image
also we have asked the customer to send a recording of their local ios setup with their certs getting installed in it ( since there might some configurations that needs access to settings )
 @Mayank Chaurasia suggested for that Dedicated devices if there are some changes (edited) ",,,

Plan Name: Enterprise App Live - Team Pro (Annual)
The above user is using the Biometric authentication feature and is able to see the Pass and Fail popup
However, they are unable to login to their application with Pass and getting an error message
As per the investigation the CE had suggested the below three options to the customer since the change in signature was casuing the issue:
1) Add BrowserStack's certificate to a list of approved certificates. During the App's signature check we add logic to accept either Fidelity's cert OR BrowserStack's cert. This seems to be the least intrusive and most sustainable solution here.
2) Disable App Signature Check for Dev Builds on BrowserStack. This works by skipping the signature check altogether so it doesn't matter which certificate the application is signed with.
3) Frida Signing + Offline Patching. Similar to the process from today's debug session, BrowserStack would patch the application to use our Biometric Authentication methods and then Fidelity would need to resign the application using an API. BrowserStack would need to build support for this API which is currently supported for non-Frida signing.
The customer wants to go with the first option and would like to confirm whether it’s a viable option. To proceed, would you be able to share the SHA-256 digest key (64-character alphanumeric) of the certificate used to sign the app when it’s uploaded to BrowserStack?
This would allow them to integrate the key into their app signature verification logic for non-production builds. It would be an ideal and straightforward solution, avoiding the need for offline patching as per the customer.

Feature: Video Injection
Query:
One of my customers is currently facing an issue with video injection in App Live. In their flow, they’re also performing biometric authentication and image injection—both of which are working as expected. For video injection, they’re also using the supported API.
From what I understand, the issue seems to be related to padding or alignment during video injection. The use case appears to involve a liveness detection flow, where the user’s face needs to be scanned and aligned within a circular region.
I’ve asked the customer to try with a few different videos to ensure the face fits within the required region for the scan to pass. However, the customer has responded with the following concern:
""But how do I know which video will work? Do I need to record multiple videos? Don’t you have a specific format that is known to work in App Live?""
We do not have access to their app, so it’s a bit difficult to test this on our end. Could you please help with guidance or a recommended format/specification for videos that are compatible with App Live’s video injection, particularly for liveness detection use cases?

App crashing when the app is opened with the camera portion
Please describe the issue (in detail)
Customer is having an application which has a use case of taking the image via the camera and upload it for passport verification process. They are using appium + cucumber and legacy way. The camera api which they are calling inside the app and the versions for it are given below:
def camerax_version = ""1.3.2""
implementation ""androidx.camera:camera-core:${camerax_version}""
implementation ""androidx.camera:camera-camera2:${camerax_version}""

Expected Behaviour
When the camera permission is given, it should take the picture and then move ahead in the next steps. The face should be still for 3 secs and then the image is been taken.

I tried to download the app on a real device and then tried to run it and it was working as expected on my real android device.
I refered this doc and searched for any requests which are failing with the API call for camera2. But in the raw and device logs I didnt find anything with the same request.
Steps to reproduce the issue
Open the app and enter the phone number: 4242424242 / 2424242424
enter the OTP: 000000
click on the filter icon and select the citizenship as india
in the search bar, enter any destination and select it.
click on start visa at the bottom of the screen and then select any date
Here is where you have to click on ""Retake selfie"" and then the permission comes.
After this step, a pop comes up saying camera permission denied but we just need to click somewhere outside the screen and it will go. In the real devices also i am getting this, but still i am able to click the picture.
